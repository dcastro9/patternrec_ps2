Notes on the testing we have to perform:
Training Data - Randomly select 80% of your data.
Testing Data - The remaining 20% of your data.

1. Select 20%, 50%, 80% and 100% of your training data, and generate
five training sets for each subset.
  - Training Data
    - 5 random subsets of 20% of our training data.
    - 5 random subsets of 50% of our training data.
    - 5 random subsets of 80% of our training data.
    - 100% of our training data.

3. For each of the 16 training sets, do F-fold cross-validation (CV) on each of
the generated training sets. You are expected to do 2-fold, 5-fold and
leave-one-out cross validation to decide the best K. Report the cross-validation
error for the best K.
