The following explains all of the directories:
code/ - Contains all of my python code, see below how to run it.
datasets/ - Contains the datasets.
final_results/ - My code outputs the results to this folder. I have included the output already since the code takes a few hours to run. This has all of the generated figures for reference.
paper/ - Contains the LaTeX files to compile my PDF.

Run the code under the code/ folder as follows:

python alcohol_script.py
python bank_note_script_script.py
python diabetes_script.py

The code does require the following Python libraries:
Numpy
Matplotlib

These may be installed through Ubuntu by inputting the following line in terminal:
sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-matplotlib
